# 📚 Web App for Book Lovers With AI Recommendations

A web application for book enthusiasts that offers intelligent book recommendations, a dynamic community forum, a virtual marketplace and a Price Comparison for Romanian Book Merchants — all in one place.

A lite version of the application can be accessed here. As this is using free deployment services, give it a minute or two to start, since the server shuts down when there is no traffic and it turns on when a user is accessing it.

This version doesn't include the AI Recommender service as it occupies too much space and free deployment services currently do not cover its needs:
